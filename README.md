# What is Magic the Gathering?
Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic or MTG) is a tabletop and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. Released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first trading card game and had approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018,and over twenty billion Magic cards were produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity. There are currently more than 20,000 unique Magic cards, to which hundreds are added each year. Cards are sold in a variety of languages and products, including booster packs and preconstructed theme decks. Magic is a game of hidden information, meaning that each player knows secrets that the other players do not. Magic cards are divided and classified by card types and color. There are 5 basic colors in MTG. White (W), Black(B), Blue(U), Green(G), and Red(R). There is also a separate colorless classification known ass Colorless(C). Cards can have multiple colors in their color identity, for example a card can be Red(R) and White(W). It is well known throughout the magic community that certain colors, or color combinations have distinct characteristics, or styles of play associated with a certain color. Blue wants to draw cards, green wants to plat large creatures as quickly as possible, black wants to bing cards back from the graveyard, red wants to play quickly and aggressively, and white likes to lose the game.  Cards are also classified by card type Sorcery, Instant, Planeswalker, Creature, Artifact, and Land.

The goal of this project is train a model to accurately predict and classify the color identity of a creature card based off of some of the attributes the card has.
